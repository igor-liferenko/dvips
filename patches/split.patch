During prescan page locations and page numbers are associated in page_locations array.
When count0 is read from dvi file, corresponding page number is obtained via current location from the array.
TODO:
1) instead of -I use special value for -S (to reduce the patch size)
2) use sizeof in the 'for' loop and decrease size of page_locations array
3) do mypageseq via global variable instead of passing it as argument (to reduce the patch size);
for this check where else except dosection() pagenum is assigned to (except the [p]prescan phases) and if pageinit() can use that value - this must not be, because in such case pagenum and mypageseq may not correspond to each other
